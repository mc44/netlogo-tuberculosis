                            <strong>The Bacille Calmette-Gu√©rin (BCG) vaccine was developed in 1921 by Albert Calmette and Jean-Marie Camille Guerin.</strong> The use of the vaccine, however, is only recommended for children and health care workers in countries where TB is much more common. Individuals with <span class="text-warning">HIV or who are pregnant </span> are also not recommended to have the vaccine. This is because there are potential problems that the vaccine can cause without proper consultation with an expert. <span class="text-primary">Low risk of infection with the bacteria on the vaccination, variable effectiveness of the vaccine on pulmonary TB, and potential interference of skin tests for TB</span>. This is why the vaccine is only recommended to certain demographics who are qualified to need it and potentially have better pros with the vaccine.

                            <h4>Medication/Treatment</h4>
                            Today, there are four drugs used to treat TB disease, namely: <span class="text-success">isoniazid (1951), pyrazinamide (1952), ethambutol (1961), and rifampin (1966)</span>. 
                            This 4-drug cocktail is still the widely used treatment for drug-susceptible TB.
            
                            <p>Medication should be taken for around <span class="text-primary">6-12 months</span> depending on the professional. The schedule for taking the treatment should always be followed to avoid the cases of being sick again, or worse, <span class="text-warning">the bacteria become drug-resistant to those medications</span>. Drug-resistant TB would then need harsher or more toxic treatments to remove it.</div>

                            <h4>Standard Simulation</h4>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Standard simulation only involves %cough, %infectiousness, %death, air-contamination-duration, and dormant-to-active </li>
                                    <li>All latent tb infected will always become sick, sick individuals will always die and potentially infect others. Many will survive depending on variables presented above. As sick? agents may die without infecting other agents</li>
                                </ul>
                            <h4>With active tb testing and medication</h4>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Includes: %willingness-active-tb, active-to-healthy-with-medication, %ability-to-detect-tb, %willingness-to-continue-medication</li>
                                    <li>Even with good values in all new included variables, simulation found it difficult to sustain the society. Sick people become healthy for sure, but almost always becomes latent cases, bringing in more sick agents, no isolation means sick agents that are diagnosed can still infect healthy agents.</li>
                                </ul>
                            <h4>With no symptoms testing and medication (expensive amount of tests)</h4>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Includes: %willingness-no-symptoms, </li>
                                    <li>Successful simulations with good %willingness-no-symptoms, assuming they continue medication to recover, it is very expensive however, testing many times</li>
                                </ul>
                            <h4>Testing success chances and frequency</h4>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Includes:days-interval-for-testing-tb</li>
                                    <li>By default, testing chances happen every 24ticks/1day, can change this until 31 days, on an ideal world, the more tests the better. The expenses and logistics are realistically a nightmare however.</li>
                                </ul>
                            <h4>With chances of drug-resistant-tb</h4>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Includes: %chance-resistant-to-meds-on-skip</li>
                                    <li>Once the bacteria develops resistance, sick? agents will infect and die, so the %chance is very sensitive</li>
                                </ul>
                            <h4>With willingness to isolate</h4>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Includes:%willingness-to-isolate</li>
                                    <li>Even when there is only a small chance of isolation, there are many healthy agents that are saved in comparison to it not existing.</li>
                                    <li>When in isolation, they still have a chance to die based on medication, but will no longer infect other people</li>
                                </ul>
                            <h4>With immune-system calculation (for dormant tb)</h4>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Includes: %immune-system-fighting-latent-tb</li>
                                    <li>This gives better chances to survive tb, immune systems when strong have a chance to not develop into active tb</li>
                                    <li>Even without medication implemented, some latent tb or dormant? state agent becomes healthy</li>
                                    <li>The stronger the immune system, the likelihood of becoming sick? becomes less, the likelihood of becoming healthy becomes more, even without meds and diagnosis</li>
                                </ul>
                            <h4>Recognizing deaths</h4>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Includes:%effect-of-deaths-to-willingness</li>
                                    <li>Being affected or feeling the urgency depending on the amount of deaths witnessed in the population is grounded to reality</li>
                                    <li>The slider however can become sensitive as even slight adjustments can increase isolation, medication, and testing. Which improve overall turnouts in the simulation</li>

                            <h4>Chances of dying per hour</h4>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Even with small chances of death, rolling the dice per hour increases the likelihood. Therefore a different calculation for %death may be needed</li>
                                </ul>
                            <h4>Willingness calculations</h4>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Willingness odds are very important in understanding agent decisions. Realistically, only agents with symptoms will have bigger chances of wanting to get tested.</li>
                                </ul>
                            <h4>Continuing medication chances</h4>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>With drug-resistant tb being dangerous in this simulation, continuing medication chances are very crucial. Even around 90% is already dangerous, as one skip can cause resistance based on the other chances</li>
                                    <li>This is very important as it is being tested the whole duration of the assigned recovery time</li>
                                </ul>
                            <h4>Not dying while on meds</h4>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Realistically, there should be different chances of death even under medication or isolation. This simulation makes it so that when using the medication continously, the agent will not die.</li>
                                </ul>
                            <h4>Not spreading drug-resistant tb, or not having harmful medication to agents with drug-resistant tb</h4>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Realistically, once you develop drug-resistant tb, other agents infected by you should also get drug-resistant tb, this is not however the case for the simulation.</li>
                                </ul>
                            <h4>Immune System, depending on agent statuses, (with hiv, smoker, alcoholic, diabetes, others)</h4>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Varying immune system levels in the society should make the simulation better, having uniform immune system may not be accurate and will not reflect or instantiate situations where agents also have other complications aside from tb.</li>
                                </ul>
                            <h4>Recognizing death, better formula, or choice to only apply to certain willingness chances</h4>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>There should be a better calculation for recognizing death which translates into willingness to isolate, medicate, and get tested</li>
                                    <li>Willingness effect should also be adjustable by the user as to what types of willingness it will touch.</li>
